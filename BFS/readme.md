This directory holds the code for the Breadth First Search algorithm. Given any valid maze, the algorithm will find a path between two points (though not always optimal). 

By creating a graph of nodes from Graph.py, the BFS algorithms can parse the graph and find any possible solution. DrawBFS also has the functionality of graphically displaying the maze and its solution.

MazeGenerator.py draws most given graphs for the users instead of having to hand code each maze. There is an upper limit as to the size of the maze.

The maze.py file and the beginning of main.py was provided by Dr. Mohammad Nassar from the University of New Haven.

See main.py for an example use of the provided classes and functions.

The visual graphics of the maze and DrawBFS.py rely on Turtle graphics.

### Future Features/Fixes:
* Get valid coordinates from input maze

## The following is the given assignment:

```
CSCI-4478 Assignment 2

Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze. The code for the maze generation is attached maze.py

Formulate this problem as a search problem: what are the states, possible actions, goal state, etc. 

Implement BFS or DFS to solve this problem. 

Integrate your code in the following main file main.py 

Please submit a document file (PDF for example) explaining your approach.

Also submit a self-contained notebook of your solution (ipynb file). 
```
