This directory holds the code for the finding a path to solve a given maze.

The maze.py file and the beginning of main.py was provided by Dr. Mohammad Nassar from the University of New Haven.

### Future Features/Fixes:
* Draw a graphic based on a text file
* Get valid coordinates from input maze
* Put author name in the files

## The following is the given assignment:

```
CSCI-4478 Assignment 2

Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze. The code for the maze generation is attached maze.py

Formulate this problem as a search problem: what are the states, possible actions, goal state, etc. 

Implement BFS or DFS to solve this problem. 

Integrate your code in the following main file main.py 

Please submit a document file (PDF for example) explaining your approach.

Also submit a self-contained notebook of your solution (ipynb file).
